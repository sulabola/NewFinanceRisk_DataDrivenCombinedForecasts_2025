# On the Superiority of Data-Driven Combined Forecasts Based on Deep Learning Models

Forecasting financial asset prices and quantifying associated risks are critical challenges in computational finance. This study presents an optimal forecast combination framework by integrating advanced time series models and machine learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy and risk assessment. A novel data-driven risk measure ($DDRisk_{new}$) based on price differences is introduced, and $sign$ correlation is used to capture risk and mitigate the limitations of traditional risk metrics. Our approach incorporates state-of-the-art forecasting models, including ARIMA, Neural Network Autoregressive, Long Short-Term Memory, XGBoost, and Random Forest, alongside two combination methods: equally weighted averages (FComp\_SA) and data-driven optimal weighted averages (FComp\_Weighted).
